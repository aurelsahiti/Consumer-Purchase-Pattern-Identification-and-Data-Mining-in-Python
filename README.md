README: Data Mining and Consumer Purchase Pattern Identification

Project Title
Consumer Purchase Pattern Identification Using Apriori and Brute Force Algorithms

Description
This project identifies shopping patterns and frequent itemsets by implementing the Apriori and Brute Force algorithms for association rule mining. The data was analyzed using Python and visualized with ggplot2 to understand consumer purchasing behavior and patterns.

Key Features

Apriori Algorithm: Applied to discover frequent itemsets and rules in transaction data.

Brute Force Algorithm: Compared with Apriori to evaluate efficiency in pattern detection.

Data Visualization: Insights visualized using regression models and plots.

Tools & Libraries Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, ggplot2

Files

AprioriAlgorithm.py: Python script implementing the Apriori algorithm.

BruteForceAlgorithm.py: Python script for the Brute Force approach.

TransactionData.csv: Dataset containing consumer transactions.

README.md: This documentation.

How to Run:
Clone the repository and place the TransactionData.csv in the root directory.
Run the AprioriAlgorithm.py and BruteForceAlgorithm.py scripts to compare the performance of both algorithms.
The output will include frequent itemsets and visualized insights.
