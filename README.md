# README: Data Mining and Consumer Purchase Pattern Identification

### Project Title
Consumer Purchase Pattern Identification Using Apriori and Brute Force Algorithms

### Description
This project identifies shopping patterns and frequent itemsets by implementing the Apriori and Brute Force algorithms for association rule mining. The data was analyzed using Python and visualized with ggplot2 to understand consumer purchasing behavior and patterns.

### Key Features
Apriori Algorithm: Applied to discover frequent itemsets and rules in transaction data.

Brute Force Algorithm: Compared with Apriori to evaluate efficiency in pattern detection.

Data Visualization: Insights visualized using regression models and plots.

### Tools & Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, matplotlib, ggplot2
